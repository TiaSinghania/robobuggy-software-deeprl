BEGIN -- Rolls PR
<!--
Rolls PRs are for individual features that are being merged into the `rolls` branch. These should be small, focused
changes.
-->

### Overview
<!--
Add a brief description of the changes made in this PR in a few sentences at the top. If it is already documented
enough in issues and/or PR title, this section can be omitted.
-->

### Linked Issues
<!--
Link any relevant issues here that should be resolved when this PR is closed. If there are none, this section can be
omitted.

IMPORTANT - make sure to Development -> Cog icon -> Add linked issue(s) in the sidebar, *after* the PR is created so
that they are automatically closed when this PR is merged.
-->
#(issue number)

### Tasks
<!--
List tasks here that must be completed before the PR can be merged.

These are intended to be mostly trivial changes and testing tasks (such as mock rolls), where that the code will not
change significantly after initial review. Changes that require sync with firmware (such as the serial protocol) should
also be included here. If there are larger changes that need to be made, this should be a draft PR until those changes
are finished.

If there is an open 2PR from rolls -> main, there must be a task to close it and merge main into this branch.

Edit below tasks as needed.
-->
- [ ] Test in sim
- [ ] Test during mock rolls
- [ ] Close #(CURRENT 2PR HERE) and merge main into this branch

### Testing
<!--
For any involved testing tasks above, describe how they will be tested here. Typically this section is omitted as
testing is usually straightforward ("Make sure this looks correct and doesn't crash").
-->
END -- Rolls PR

BEGIN -- Documentation PR
<!--
Documentation PRs are for changes to documentation only that are being merged into the `main` branch. These should not
include any code changes.

Include a brief description of the changes made in this PR in a few sentences at the top if it is not already clear from
title and linked issues. As with rolls PRs, link any relevant issues here that should be resolved when this PR is
closed and add them to the sidebar after the PR is created.
-->
END -- Documentation PR

BEGIN -- 2PR
<!--
2PRs are for merging changes from the `rolls` branch into the `main` branch. These should be created after rolls every
week, and summarize the changes that were made that week. This should be reviewed live during weekly software standup
meetings to ensure that everything is captured accurately.
-->
### Summary of changes
<!--
Link PRs that were merged into rolls here, and any additional changes that were committed directly to rolls.
-->
- #(PR number)
- Other minor change

### Rolls Results
<!--
Describe what happened and/or outcomes of the rolls. If there was anything that didn't work, also describe them here.
-->
END -- 2PR
